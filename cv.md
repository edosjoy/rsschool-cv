## About me

I am currently the head of IT projects. I am responsible for the development of various e-commerce products. Before that, I was engaged in SEO optimization of websites for a long time. I was also engaged in the administration and refinement of sites (sites without CMS, self-written and boxed CMS).

All the time I was attracted to development as a programmer. For the sake of interest, I studied various programming languages. I chose JavaScript, because that's where there is user interaction and a tangible return on your work.

Thanks to my great interest in development, I study with pleasure. And made the final decision to become a JavaScript developer.

As I study JavaScript, I do small projects. I post some of them on my [github account](https://github.com/edosjoy).
