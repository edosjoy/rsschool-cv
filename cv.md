## About me
I am currently the head of IT projects. I am responsible for the development of various e-commerce products. Before that, I was engaged in SEO optimization of websites for a long time. I have always been interested in development and in addition to my main work, I have performed various tasks to finalize websites.

I have always been attracted to development as a programmer. For the sake of interest, I studied various programming languages. Recently, I have been closely studying FrontEnd development. I have taken various courses, read books, watch videos and put my knowledge into practice.

Thanks to my great interest in development, I study with pleasure. I feel that there are not enough real tasks right now, there is not enough work in a real team for further development and becoming a full-fledged Frontend developer.

While studying JavaScript, I am engaged in small projects. I post some of them in my account on https://github.com/edosjoy.
